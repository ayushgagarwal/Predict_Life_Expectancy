# Predict Life Expectancy

The model predicts the life expectancy of a person considering a number of factors like developing/developed country, income, schooling, medical history, alcohol, etc.

I have pre-processed and performed EDA on the data before moving to choosing the model. 

I have used Linear Regression to make the prediction with R-squared value being 0.82., hence I think the model performs reasonably well to make the prediction.
